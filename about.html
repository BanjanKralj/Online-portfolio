<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Matija Banjan, I live in a coastal town in Croatia. Work an an integration engineer for SIP technology for an Telecom IT company.</p>

<p>In my free time I enjoy working out, playing chess, listening to all different sorts of music, watching anime, learning new languages, watching combat sports, and as of recently, I've enrolled
  in a full stack development course.
</p>

<p>I love animals, with crocs and gators being my favourite ones. I am a dog person by default, but also generally enjoy a company of cats. 
  I've practices multiple sports, with biggest majority of my adolescent life being focused on Tae Kwon-Do, in which I hold a black belt.
